useeffect --- it will say how many times you can call the function

syntax : 


useeffect(  callback, dependency  )


useeffect(

    () => {
        fetchTodos()
    }, []

)

usage : when i call the async funtion directly it is calling backend continuously it will damage the performace

for that we use useeffect function(hooks) to call only one time


dependency : 

[]  ---- this useeffect hook not depending on anything, the fetchtodos function call only one time that too on page load

[variablename] ---- useeffect depends on this variablename, when i update the variablename, it will call the fetchTodos function once again
